# Add one question per line. Lines starting with # are ignored.
# These questions will be answered by the LLM using the analyzed call data.
#
# Usage:
#   python3 tools/run_analysis.py -n 50 --questions questions.txt
#
# Tips:
# - Ask specific, data-driven questions
# - Questions about patterns, correlations, and root causes work well
# - The LLM has access to metrics, failure details, customer verbatims, and conversation quality data
